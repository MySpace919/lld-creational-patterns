Observer Design Pattern — Notes

1️⃣ Definition

Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects —
so that when one object (the Subject / Observable) changes its state,
all its dependent objects (Observers) are automatically notified and updated.

2️⃣ Intent

Used when multiple objects need to be notified automatically about changes in another object’s state.

Goal:

Promote loose coupling between the observable and its observers.

Ensure that adding or removing observers doesn’t affect other parts of the system.

3️⃣ Participants
Role	Responsibility	Example in Your Code
Observable (Subject)	Holds the core state (e.g., stock count), maintains a list of observers, and notifies them on state change.	StockObservableImpl
Observer	Subscribes to an observable and defines a custom update() method to react to notifications.	EmailNotificationObserverImpl, SMSNotificationObserverImpl
Client	Creates the observable and observer objects and wires them together.	Main.java


4️⃣ How It Works — Flow

Observers register themselves with an observable.

Observable maintains a list of registered observers.

When the observable’s state changes (e.g., stock update):

It calls notifyObserver().

Each observer’s update() method is triggered.

Observers react to the change (send email, SMS, etc.).

5️⃣ Key Design Principles
Principle	Explanation
Loose Coupling	The observable doesn’t need to know how observers handle updates — it just calls update().
Open/Closed Principle	New observer types (e.g., WhatsAppNotificationObserver) can be added without modifying observable code.
Single Responsibility Principle	The observable manages state and subscriptions, while observers manage notification logic.
Encapsulation	Each observer encapsulates its own data (email, phone number, etc.) and behavior.


6️⃣ When to Use the Observer Pattern

✅ When multiple components need to react to the same event.
✅ When the event source and event handlers should be independent.
✅ Common Real-World Use Cases:

Stock update notification systems

Weather stations broadcasting updates to displays

Chat/messaging systems (listeners receiving messages)

GUI frameworks (button click listeners)

Event-driven backends (Kafka, Event Bus, etc.)

7️⃣ Advantages

✅ Promotes loose coupling between event sources and listeners.
✅ Easy to add/remove observers at runtime.
✅ Encourages modular, event-driven architecture.
✅ Improves scalability and flexibility of the system.

8️⃣ Example Summary (Your Code)
Component	    Example                     	        Description
Observable	    StockObservableImpl("iPhone")	    Manages stock count and observer list.
Observer	    EmailNotificationObserverImpl,
                SMSNotificationObserverImpl	        React to stock updates.
Client	        Main.java	                        Creates and connects observables and observers.

Flow:

Observers subscribe to products.

Observable stock changes → calls notifyObserver().

All subscribed observers receive update notifications.

        | update() → send SMS       |

🧩 10️⃣ Key Takeaway

Observer pattern is perfect for building reactive, event-driven systems where multiple components should respond to the same change — without tightly coupling them together.
